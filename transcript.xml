<text start="1.76" dur="6.06">During the Cold War the US and the Soviet Union had to build underground silos to house</text>
<text start="7.86" dur="3.38">nuclear missiles that could be launched at a few minutes notice.</text>
<text start="11.36" dur="2.84">Now, one of the technical challenges they had to overcome that you might not think of</text>
<text start="14.28" dur="1.48">is acoustics.</text>
<text start="16.1" dur="3.3">Launching a missile in such a confined silo generates</text>
<text start="19.58" dur="3.78">a loud sound, so loud that it would&#39;ve shaken apart the missiles</text>
<text start="23.44" dur="1.88">before they could even launch.</text>
<text start="25.36" dur="3.44">So the walls of the inside of the silo had to be covered</text>
<text start="28.88" dur="2.08">in acoustically absorbent tiles,</text>
<text start="30.98" dur="3.5">very similar to those in the world&#39;s quietest room.</text>
<text start="34.9" dur="3.36">But after all of the technical challenges were sorted,</text>
<text start="38.52" dur="3.7">what I wanted to know was &#39;how could they have launched these missiles</text>
<text start="42.32" dur="4.28">very quickly, if needed, but also never by accident?&#39;</text>
<text start="46.88" dur="3.8">So I visited one of these Titan missile silos in the Arizona desert</text>
<text start="50.74" dur="4.4">to find out exactly what it would have taken to launch a nuclear missile.</text>
<text start="58.46" dur="6.14">Well, Derek this is level 2 of the silo, we are down some 10 meters below the surface now.</text>
<text start="65" dur="1.3">And this...</text>
<text start="67.02" dur="1.34">is the launch duct.</text>
<text start="73.62" dur="2.1">— Wow. — And that is Titan II.</text>
<text start="76.42" dur="5.9">The largest and most powerful missile weapons system ever deployed by the United States.</text>
<text start="82.52" dur="1.46">And what kind of bomb is in there?</text>
<text start="84.08" dur="1.94">That is a thermonuclear bomb.</text>
<text start="86.28" dur="1.56">It is a 9 megaton weapon.</text>
<text start="88.04" dur="1.6">Compared to Hiroshima?</text>
<text start="89.88" dur="3.08">Oh, call it 650 times.</text>
<text start="93.62" dur="2.16">An enormously powerful weapon.</text>
<text start="96.2" dur="1.82">And what was the idea with it?</text>
<text start="98.1" dur="5.94">The idea behind Titan II was to instill enough fear in the mind of the enemy,</text>
<text start="104.52" dur="3.88">to cause them to think twice about launching an attack against us.</text>
<text start="108.52" dur="5.26">Knowing that 10 meters below the desert in our fortified concrete bunker,</text>
<text start="113.82" dur="5.28">we could ride out their first strike, and live to retaliate, if we&#39;re forced to do that,</text>
<text start="119.18" dur="4.2">the consequences for the enemy would be so unspeakably horrible</text>
<text start="123.42" dur="3.18">that maybe they would prefer not to get into it with us in the first place.</text>
<text start="126.96" dur="2.32">That&#39;s the essence of deterrence.</text>
<text start="129.92" dur="3.86">This missile is no longer active, but the launch system is preserved.</text>
<text start="134.14" dur="4.46">And I wanted an insight into how it felt to control this incredible power.</text>
<text start="139.76" dur="1.76">Can we go launch one?</text>
<text start="142.26" dur="1.98">I thought you&#39;d never ask!</text>
<text start="148.22" dur="5.58">There were 54 of these silos, each one staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</text>
<text start="154.96" dur="5.42">Ready to launch their missiles on the exclusive order of the President of the United States.</text>
<text start="160.66" dur="2.54">Alright then, have a seat here Commander.</text>
<text start="163.24" dur="0.98">Thank you.</text>
<text start="165.14" dur="4.08">So, this is the control center, this is where the crew waited to launch the missile.</text>
<text start="169.24" dur="2.32">And how do we know when we need to launch?</text>
<text start="171.7" dur="2.36">[Speaker beeping]</text>
<text start="174.84" dur="5.5">On radio: &#39;Alpha, 2, 3, Charlie, Hotel, Victor&#39; (A23CHV)</text>
<text start="180.54" dur="3.98">So, we&#39;re going to write down every letter and number that we hear in a form in this notebook.</text>
<text start="184.6" dur="2.22">I&#39;m going to write it down in this notebook.</text>
<text start="187.04" dur="3.62">We&#39;ll compare each other&#39;s work. If we agree that we&#39;ve copied the message correctly,</text>
<text start="190.78" dur="1.7">then we have what&#39;s called a &#39;valid message,&#39;</text>
<text start="192.88" dur="2.5">and authorization to take our lock off the big red safe.</text>
<text start="195.48" dur="2.6">You know your combination, I know mine, we don&#39;t know each other,</text>
<text start="198.12" dur="2.2">so we both have to agree to get inside.</text>
<text start="200.36" dur="1.56">Inside we find authenticator cards.</text>
<text start="201.94" dur="1.48">I&#39;ll give those to you.</text>
<text start="204.2" dur="3.44">In the secret message, they sent us a seven-character code word.</text>
<text start="207.68" dur="2.88">We&#39;re going to look at the first two letters of the code word, we&#39;re going to find the authenticator</text>
<text start="210.58" dur="1.28">that has those first two letters.</text>
<text start="211.88" dur="5.74">If the card here matches the code word they sent us, then this is a legitimate order to go.</text>
<text start="217.7" dur="3.22">That gives us permission to put in our launch keys. I&#39;ve already put them in for us.</text>
<text start="220.94" dur="4.04">Key right here for you, commander. And for me there&#39;s a key right over here.</text>
<text start="225.02" dur="3.9">The keys are far enough apart that not even a long-armed guy like me can reach them both.</text>
<text start="229.14" dur="2.5">The keys must be turned within 2 seconds of each other</text>
<text start="231.66" dur="2.06">and held, they&#39;re spring loaded,</text>
<text start="233.76" dur="2.58">so held for 5 seconds to start the launch.</text>
<text start="236.38" dur="2.82">That guarantees that two people will be required to do it.</text>
<text start="239.24" dur="1.98">You just can&#39;t run back and forth and do it yourself.</text>
<text start="241.24" dur="3.86">And last but not least, we need the secret unlock code for the missle.</text>
<text start="245.12" dur="4.88">Six little wheels. Each little wheel has 16 letters of the alphabet.</text>
<text start="251.64" dur="2.46">Nominally 17 million combinations.</text>
<text start="254.48" dur="2.1">Only one will operate the missile.</text>
<text start="256.6" dur="4.78">This is the fail safe that prevents an unauthorized or accidental launch of the missle.</text>
<text start="261.64" dur="5.08">So once we have all those things: authentication, keys, code, we&#39;re good to go.</text>
<text start="266.74" dur="1.36">— All set? — Let&#39;s do it.</text>
<text start="268.16" dur="3.32">Give me a countdown, &quot;3-2-1 Turn keys&quot;, we&#39;ll send this thing on it&#39;s way.</text>
<text start="271.5" dur="1.92">After you comander.</text>
<text start="273.5" dur="0.7">3...</text>
<text start="274.22" dur="0.8">2...</text>
<text start="275.04" dur="0.72">1...</text>
<text start="275.9" dur="1.26">Turn keys.</text>
<text start="278" dur="2.04">And hold.</text>
<text start="280.96" dur="1.48">Okay, you may release.</text>
<text start="282.48" dur="1.64">That&#39;s all there is to it.</text>
<text start="284.16" dur="2.04">The green light turns on. Its says &quot;Launch enable&quot;.</text>
<text start="287.48" dur="4.72">For all intents and purposes, that should say &quot;Welcome to World War III&quot;</text>
<text start="292.28" dur="1.6">Because that&#39;s pretty much what it boils down to.</text>
<text start="293.9" dur="4.72">When you turn the key you are committed. There is no &quot;Oops&quot; switch anywhere.</text>
<text start="298.66" dur="3.46">When the batteries come to full power, the missile will transfer to internal power,</text>
<text start="302.14" dur="2.2">meaning that it is fully independent.</text>
<text start="304.38" dur="3.42">About that same time, the silo door starts to slide open.</text>
<text start="311.5" dur="4.7">It will slide through security radar beams and set off the alarm.</text>
<text start="316.38" dur="2.02">That gives us &quot;Silo Soft&quot;.</text>
<text start="318.44" dur="3.66">&quot;Guidance Go&quot; means the internal guidance computer has full control of the mission.</text>
<text start="322.22" dur="2.58">In a few seconds we&#39;ll have main engine start.</text>
<text start="326.6" dur="2.66">From engine start we will build up thrust.</text>
<text start="329.3" dur="1.36">Pump the hold down bolts.</text>
<text start="331.86" dur="1.44">And off you go.</text>
<text start="333.38" dur="1.64">Into the wild we know.</text>
<text start="347.56" dur="3.48">So that&#39;s it? We just basically just ended life on Earth.</text>
<text start="352.66" dur="1.18">As you know it.</text>
<text start="364.64" dur="3.6">In these silos, the Titan missiles had a terrifying purpose.</text>
<text start="368.36" dur="4.92">But they were also put to much better uses, minus their war-head of course.</text>
<text start="373.3" dur="5.3">For example, the Voyager spacecraft was launched into space atop a Titan III missile.</text>
<text start="378.64" dur="4.2">And Neil Armstrong took his first flight into space atop a Titan II.</text>
<text start="382.88" dur="4.74">The exact same missile that would have delivered nuclear warheads to the Soviet Union.</text>
<text start="387.9" dur="6.04">So the Cold War didn&#39;t only bring us this fear and potential of mutually assured destruction,</text>
<text start="394.14" dur="3.74">it also made space exploration possible.</text>
<text start="398.76" dur="5.52">Now I want to say thank you to everyone for writing in to request that this documentary be played in your area.</text>
<text start="404.3" dur="4.98">Thanks to you, we&#39;ve managed to get it broadcast in Norway, Sweden and the Middle East.</text>
