1
00:0:1,760 --> 00:0:7,819
During the Cold War the US and the Soviet Union had to build underground silos to house

2
00:0:7,860 --> 00:0:11,240
nuclear missiles that could be launched at a few minutes notice.

3
00:0:11,359 --> 00:0:14,199
Now, one of the technical challenges they had to overcome that you might not think of

4
00:0:14,279 --> 00:0:15,759
is acoustics.

5
00:0:16,100 --> 00:0:19,400
Launching a missile in such a confined silo generates

6
00:0:19,579 --> 00:0:23,359
a loud sound, so loud that it would've shaken apart the missiles

7
00:0:23,440 --> 00:0:25,320
before they could even launch.

8
00:0:25,359 --> 00:0:28,800
So the walls of the inside of the silo had to be covered

9
00:0:28,879 --> 00:0:30,960
in acoustically absorbent tiles,

10
00:0:30,980 --> 00:0:34,480
very similar to those in the world's quietest room.

11
00:0:34,899 --> 00:0:38,259
But after all of the technical challenges were sorted,

12
00:0:38,520 --> 00:0:42,220
what I wanted to know was 'how could they have launched these missiles

13
00:0:42,320 --> 00:0:46,600
very quickly, if needed, but also never by accident?'

14
00:0:46,880 --> 00:0:50,679
So I visited one of these Titan missile silos in the Arizona desert

15
00:0:50,740 --> 00:0:55,140
to find out exactly what it would have taken to launch a nuclear missile.

16
00:0:58,460 --> 00:1:4,599
Well, Derek this is level 2 of the silo, we are down some 10 meters below the surface now.

17
00:1:5,000 --> 00:1:6,299
And this...

18
00:1:7,019 --> 00:1:8,359
is the launch duct.

19
00:1:13,620 --> 00:1:15,719
— Wow. — And that is Titan II.

20
00:1:16,420 --> 00:1:22,320
The largest and most powerful missile weapons system ever deployed by the United States.

21
00:1:22,519 --> 00:1:23,979
And what kind of bomb is in there?

22
00:1:24,079 --> 00:1:26,019
That is a thermonuclear bomb.

23
00:1:26,280 --> 00:1:27,840
It is a 9 megaton weapon.

24
00:1:28,040 --> 00:1:29,640
Compared to Hiroshima?

25
00:1:29,879 --> 00:1:32,959
Oh, call it 650 times.

26
00:1:33,620 --> 00:1:35,780
An enormously powerful weapon.

27
00:1:36,200 --> 00:1:38,019
And what was the idea with it?

28
00:1:38,099 --> 00:1:44,039
The idea behind Titan II was to instill enough fear in the mind of the enemy,

29
00:1:44,519 --> 00:1:48,399
to cause them to think twice about launching an attack against us.

30
00:1:48,519 --> 00:1:53,780
Knowing that 10 meters below the desert in our fortified concrete bunker,

31
00:1:53,819 --> 00:1:59,099
we could ride out their first strike, and live to retaliate, if we're forced to do that,

32
00:1:59,180 --> 00:2:3,380
the consequences for the enemy would be so unspeakably horrible

33
00:2:3,420 --> 00:2:6,600
that maybe they would prefer not to get into it with us in the first place.

34
00:2:6,959 --> 00:2:9,280
That's the essence of deterrence.

35
00:2:9,919 --> 00:2:13,780
This missile is no longer active, but the launch system is preserved.

36
00:2:14,139 --> 00:2:18,599
And I wanted an insight into how it felt to control this incredible power.

37
00:2:19,759 --> 00:2:21,519
Can we go launch one?

38
00:2:22,259 --> 00:2:24,239
I thought you'd never ask!

39
00:2:28,219 --> 00:2:33,800
There were 54 of these silos, each one staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

40
00:2:34,960 --> 00:2:40,379
Ready to launch their missiles on the exclusive order of the President of the United States.

41
00:2:40,659 --> 00:2:43,199
Alright then, have a seat here Commander.

42
00:2:43,240 --> 00:2:44,219
Thank you.

43
00:2:45,139 --> 00:2:49,219
So, this is the control center, this is where the crew waited to launch the missile.

44
00:2:49,240 --> 00:2:51,560
And how do we know when we need to launch?

45
00:2:51,699 --> 00:2:54,060
[Speaker beeping]

46
00:2:54,840 --> 00:3:0,340
On radio: 'Alpha, 2, 3, Charlie, Hotel, Victor' (A23CHV)

47
00:3:0,539 --> 00:3:4,519
So, we're going to write down every letter and number that we hear in a form in this notebook.

48
00:3:4,599 --> 00:3:6,819
I'm going to write it down in this notebook.

49
00:3:7,039 --> 00:3:10,659
We'll compare each other's work. If we agree that we've copied the message correctly,

50
00:3:10,780 --> 00:3:12,479
then we have what's called a 'valid message,'

51
00:3:12,879 --> 00:3:15,379
and authorization to take our lock off the big red safe.

52
00:3:15,479 --> 00:3:18,079
You know your combination, I know mine, we don't know each other,

53
00:3:18,120 --> 00:3:20,319
so we both have to agree to get inside.

54
00:3:20,360 --> 00:3:21,920
Inside we find authenticator cards.

55
00:3:21,939 --> 00:3:23,419
I'll give those to you.

56
00:3:24,199 --> 00:3:27,639
In the secret message, they sent us a seven-character code word.

57
00:3:27,680 --> 00:3:30,560
We're going to look at the first two letters of the code word, we're going to find the authenticator

58
00:3:30,580 --> 00:3:31,860
that has those first two letters.

59
00:3:31,879 --> 00:3:37,620
If the card here matches the code word they sent us, then this is a legitimate order to go.

60
00:3:37,699 --> 00:3:40,919
That gives us permission to put in our launch keys. I've already put them in for us.

61
00:3:40,939 --> 00:3:44,979
Key right here for you, commander. And for me there's a key right over here.

62
00:3:45,020 --> 00:3:48,920
The keys are far enough apart that not even a long-armed guy like me can reach them both.

63
00:3:49,139 --> 00:3:51,639
The keys must be turned within 2 seconds of each other

64
00:3:51,659 --> 00:3:53,719
and held, they're spring loaded,

65
00:3:53,759 --> 00:3:56,340
so held for 5 seconds to start the launch.

66
00:3:56,379 --> 00:3:59,199
That guarantees that two people will be required to do it.

67
00:3:59,240 --> 00:4:1,219
You just can't run back and forth and do it yourself.

68
00:4:1,240 --> 00:4:5,100
And last but not least, we need the secret unlock code for the missle.

69
00:4:5,120 --> 00:4:10,000
Six little wheels. Each little wheel has 16 letters of the alphabet.

70
00:4:11,639 --> 00:4:14,099
Nominally 17 million combinations.

71
00:4:14,479 --> 00:4:16,579
Only one will operate the missile.

72
00:4:16,600 --> 00:4:21,379
This is the fail safe that prevents an unauthorized or accidental launch of the missle.

73
00:4:21,639 --> 00:4:26,719
So once we have all those things: authentication, keys, code, we're good to go.

74
00:4:26,740 --> 00:4:28,100
— All set? — Let's do it.

75
00:4:28,160 --> 00:4:31,480
Give me a countdown, "3-2-1 Turn keys", we'll send this thing on it's way.

76
00:4:31,500 --> 00:4:33,420
After you comander.

77
00:4:33,500 --> 00:4:34,199
3...

78
00:4:34,220 --> 00:4:35,020
2...

79
00:4:35,040 --> 00:4:35,760
1...

80
00:4:35,899 --> 00:4:37,159
Turn keys.

81
00:4:38,000 --> 00:4:40,040
And hold.

82
00:4:40,959 --> 00:4:42,439
Okay, you may release.

83
00:4:42,480 --> 00:4:44,120
That's all there is to it.

84
00:4:44,160 --> 00:4:46,200
The green light turns on. Its says "Launch enable".

85
00:4:47,480 --> 00:4:52,200
For all intents and purposes, that should say "Welcome to World War III"

86
00:4:52,279 --> 00:4:53,879
Because that's pretty much what it boils down to.

87
00:4:53,899 --> 00:4:58,620
When you turn the key you are committed. There is no "Oops" switch anywhere.

88
00:4:58,660 --> 00:5:2,120
When the batteries come to full power, the missile will transfer to internal power,

89
00:5:2,139 --> 00:5:4,339
meaning that it is fully independent.

90
00:5:4,379 --> 00:5:7,800
About that same time, the silo door starts to slide open.

91
00:5:11,500 --> 00:5:16,199
It will slide through security radar beams and set off the alarm.

92
00:5:16,379 --> 00:5:18,399
That gives us "Silo Soft".

93
00:5:18,439 --> 00:5:22,100
"Guidance Go" means the internal guidance computer has full control of the mission.

94
00:5:22,220 --> 00:5:24,800
In a few seconds we'll have main engine start.

95
00:5:26,600 --> 00:5:29,260
From engine start we will build up thrust.

96
00:5:29,300 --> 00:5:30,660
Pump the hold down bolts.

97
00:5:31,860 --> 00:5:33,300
And off you go.

98
00:5:33,379 --> 00:5:35,019
Into the wild we know.

99
00:5:47,560 --> 00:5:51,040
So that's it? We just basically just ended life on Earth.

100
00:5:52,660 --> 00:5:53,840
As you know it.

101
00:6:4,639 --> 00:6:8,240
In these silos, the Titan missiles had a terrifying purpose.

102
00:6:8,360 --> 00:6:13,280
But they were also put to much better uses, minus their war-head of course.

103
00:6:13,300 --> 00:6:18,600
For example, the Voyager spacecraft was launched into space atop a Titan III missile.

104
00:6:18,639 --> 00:6:22,839
And Neil Armstrong took his first flight into space atop a Titan II.

105
00:6:22,879 --> 00:6:27,620
The exact same missile that would have delivered nuclear warheads to the Soviet Union.

106
00:6:27,899 --> 00:6:33,939
So the Cold War didn't only bring us this fear and potential of mutually assured destruction,

107
00:6:34,139 --> 00:6:37,879
it also made space exploration possible.

108
00:6:38,759 --> 00:6:44,279
Now I want to say thank you to everyone for writing in to request that this documentary be played in your area.

109
00:6:44,300 --> 00:6:49,280
Thanks to you, we've managed to get it broadcast in Norway, Sweden and the Middle East.

110
00:6:49,319 --> 00:6:51,639
And details are in the description, so check it out.

111
00:6:51,759 --> 00:6:57,800
For everyone else, the documentray will be available online via our broadcasters

112
00:6:57,839 --> 00:7:0,000
though there may be some geo-blocking restrictions.

113
00:7:0,019 --> 00:7:6,719
But I'm pretty confident that anyone who wants to see the documentary will be able to via those means.

114
00:7:6,759 --> 00:7:11,699
So I hope you watch it, I hope you enjoy it. It premiers in just a few days in the US.

115
00:7:11,740 --> 00:7:16,060
That's July 28th: 10pm Eastern, 9 Central.

116
00:7:16,199 --> 00:7:18,560
For more details check out links in the description.

117
00:7:18,620 --> 00:7:22,939
I hope you check it out and I really hope you enjoy it. I appreciate so much your support.

118
00:7:23,100 --> 00:7:26,740
It means everything to me. So again, thanks for watching.
